Add-Migration appInit
Update-Database


A previous migration called 'appInit' was already applied to the target database.
If you meant to re-scaffold 'appInit', revert it by running
'Update-Database -TargetMigration $InitialDatabase', then delete '201802211210475_appInit.cs'
and run 'Add-Migration appInit' again.
